## Introduction

HITSZ Connect Verge is a GUI of [ZJU Connect](https://github.com/Mythologyli/zju-connect). It helps you connect to the campus network of HITSZ remotely.

## Features

- Fast and green compared to **EasyConnect**.
- Simplified UI and Fluent UI (Windows only).
- Built with PySide6 and Python, making it beginner-friendly to contribute and maintain.
- Multi-platform support, providing out-of-box experience without executing additional scripts.
- Works with other applications like Clash, Remote Desktop, and SSH. (See [Working with other applications](#working-with-other-applications))

## Installation

You can install HITSZ Connect Verge in two ways: downloading pre-built binaries or building from source.

> [!NOTE]
>
> 1. Username and password are the same as the ones you use to log in to the [Unified Identity Authentic Platform](https://ids.hit.edu.cn)
> 2. If the download speed is slow, you can try using [gh-proxy](https://gh-proxy.com) to download.

### Method 1: Downloading pre-built binaries

HITSZ Connect Verge provides out-of-the-box experience. You can download the latest version from the [release page](https://github.com/kowyo/hitsz-connect-verge/releases/latest).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For macOS version, you need to grant access to the application by running:
>
> ```bash
> sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine hitsz-connect-verge.app
> ```
>
> In some case, you need to go to macOS `Settings` -> `System Preferences` -> 
> `Security & Privacy` -> `Open Anyway`.

### Method 2: Building from source

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kowyo/hitsz-connect-verge.git
    cd hitsz-connect-verge
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create a virtual environment by running:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # activate the virtual environment
    ```

    Then, install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. (Optional) Build the binaries:

    You can build the binaries for Windows by running:

    ```bash
    pyinstaller --clean --onefile --noconsole `
    --icon assets/icon.ico `
    --add-data "assets;assets" `
    --add-data "core/zju-connect;core" `
    -n hitsz-connect-verge main.py
    ```

    For macOS/Linux, you can run the following commands:

    ```bash
    pyinstaller --clean --onefile --noconsole --windowed \
    --icon assets/icon.icns \
    --add-data "assets:assets" \
    --add-data "core/zju-connect:core" \
    -n hitsz-connect-verge main.py
    ```

## Working with other applications

### Basic information

- **Server**: vpn.hitsz.edu.cn
- **SOCKS5 Proxy**:  1080
- **HTTP Proxy**: 1081
- **DNS Server**: 10.248.98.30

If you want to learn more about the network configuration, you can visit [Mythologyli/zju-connect](https://github.com/Mythologyli/zju-connect).

### Clash

<!-- If you want to use Clash at the same time , you can add the following configuration to your clash configuration file.

```yaml
rules:
    - 'DOMAIN-SUFFIX,vpn.hitsz.edu.cn,DIRECT'
``` -->

I haven't figured out how to use it with Clash yet. If you have any ideas, please create a pull request.

### Remote Desktop

If you want to connect to the remote desktop in the campus network, you can use [Parallels Client](https://www.parallels.com/hk/products/ras/capabilities/parallels-client/), and configure the local 1080 port as a proxy.

### SSH

If you want to use SSH, you can use the following command to establish a connection.

```bash
ssh -o ProxyCommand="nc -X 5 -x 127.0.0.1:1080 %h %p" <your_root>@<your_server>
```
